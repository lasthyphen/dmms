IMPORTANT LEGAL PROVISIONS</strong></p><p><strong>a. NO WARRANTIES.</strong>THE SERVICES UNDER THE TERMS OF SERVICE, Solid’S WEBSITE, AND ITS CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES’ RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p><p>THE Solid SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OF WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. USE OF THE Solid SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Solid, BANKS, AND OUR AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AND SUPPLIERS, SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NEITHER Solid NOR BANK HAVE CONTROL OF, OR LIABILITY FOR, ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED BY PLATFORMS OR THAT ARE PAID FOR USING OUR SERVICES AND CANNOT ENSURE THAT ANY PLATFORM OR OTHER THIRD PARTY YOU TRANSACT WITH WILL COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION. NEITHER Solid NOR BANK REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT OUR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, BE CONTINUOUS, UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, TIMELY, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM Solid OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. NEITHER Solid NOR BANK SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS OR SYSTEM FAILURES THAT MAY AFFECT THE PROCESSING, COMPLETION, OR SETTLEMENT OF OUR SERVICE TRANSACTIONS. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY SECTION SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION</p><p>Solid MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES RELATING TO YOUR FUNDS OR ACCOUNT BALANCES INCLUDING FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (“FDIC”) INSURANCE COVERAGE OR SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTION CORPORATION (“SPIC”) INSURANCE COVERAGE. SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MAY BE FOUND IN THE SPECIFIC ACCOUNT AGREEMENT OR AGREEMENT WITH YOUR PLATFORM. UNLESS NOTIFIED OTHERWISE BY SUCH AGREEMENTS, YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCES MAY LOSE VALUE IN THE EVENT BANK OR BROKER DEALER ENTERS A RECEIVERSHIP.</p><p><strong>b. Force majeure.</strong>You understand and agree we will not be held responsible for any losses or damages resulting from suspension of service due to extraordinary events or circumstances beyond our control. In such an event, Solid or Bank may suspend the services and access to your Account held by Bank or Platform for your benefit.</p><p><strong>c. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCIDENTAL, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) RESULTING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE Solid’S, BANK’S, PLATFORM’S SERVICES OR WEBSITES OR PHONE APPLICATIONS OR CONTENT THEREIN WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p><p><strong>d. Indemnification.</strong>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Solid and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and suppliers (collectively “Disclaiming Entities”) from and against any third party claim, suit, demand, loss, liability, damage, action, proceeding or suits and related liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#x27; fees and other litigation expenses) arising out of or relating to (i) your breach of any provision of these Terms of Service; (ii) your actions and omissions in connection with your accounts or our services; (iii) our actions and omissions, provided that they are taken/omitted in accordance with this Terms of Service or your instructions; or (iv) your violation of any laws and regulations; or (v) your negligent or reckless act or omission or willful misconduct of your employees, contractors, or agents. This provision shall survive the termination of these Terms of Service.</p><p><strong>e. Binding Arbitration.</strong>Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. In any arbitration arising out of or related to the Terms of Service, the arbitrators will award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and attorneys’ fees awards will be offset.</p><p>No class actions or similar process, and no joinder or consolidation of any claim with a claim of any other person or entity, shall be allowable in arbitration, without the written consent of both parties. The arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain any claim on behalf of a class, group, person, or entity who is not a named party to the arbitration, nor shall any arbitrator have authority to make any award for the benefit of, or against, any class, group, person, or entity who is not a named party to the arbitration. In the event that there is a dispute about whether limiting arbitration to non-class proceedings, or to the named parties, is enforceable under applicable law, then that question shall be resolved by a court rather than by an arbitrator, and to the extent, it is determined that resolution of a claim must proceed on a class basis, it shall so proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction rather than in arbitration.</p><p>The place of arbitration shall be San Francisco, CA, except to the extent, the arbitration involves Bank and/or your Account, or a third-party service provider of Solid as a party to the dispute, then Solid may in its sole discretion move the place of arbitration to the location of such arbitration proceedings to which you have previously agreed to in such agreements (See, your specific Account Agreement Arbitration sections for more information of the place of arbitration).</p><p><strong>ARBITRATION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM IS BINDING AND NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM THROUGH A COURT. IN ARBITRATION THE PARTIES WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS THAT APPLY IN COURT, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE OR BE REPRESENTED IN PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY OTHERS SUCH AS CLASS ACTIONS OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY AND THE RIGHT TO APPEAL MAY ALSO BE LIMITED OR ELIMINATED IN ARBITRATION. ALL OF THESE JUDICIAL RIGHTS ARE WAIVED WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE PARTIES ELECT TO ARBITRATE.</strong></p><p>All claims, findings, and settlements under this “Binding Arbitration” shall be confidential information of Solid. You shall not disclose or reveal to employees, agents, Platform, or other third parties unless such information is already publicly available. Due to the unique nature of the confidential information, monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate us for your violation or threatened violation may cause irreparable injury to us and, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in law, in equity or otherwise, we shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the threatened breach of confidentiality or the continuation of any such breach by you.</p><p><strong>18. Other legal terms.</strong>The Terms of Service are governed by the laws of the State of California. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of California except as detailed in the “Binding Arbitration” Section. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be invalid by a competent court, the invalidity of such provisions shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. Likewise, if we choose to terminate any provision in accordance with the termination provision, that termination shall not affect the termination of other provisions.</p><p>If we fail to act on or enforce, any provision in the Terms of Service, this shall not be construed as a waiver of that, or any other, provision. We will only grant waivers to specific provisions, for specific instances, in writing. The Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to this website and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements. The section headings are merely provided for convenience and shall not be given any legal import. You may not assign your rights and obligations under these Terms of Service. The Terms of Service will inure to the benefit of our successors, assignees, licensees, and sublicensees.</p></div></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="page-padding"><div class="container-large"><div class="footer-inner"><div id="w-node-_9b886c16-9ede-fb79-87d2-0d55d6caec0a-d6caec06"><a aria-label="Starlight Home" href="../index.html" class="footer-logo w-inline-block"><div class="svg-embed w-embed"><svg width="150" height="27" viewBox="0 0 150 27" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
